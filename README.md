# react-todo

Simple todo list using React, Typescript and Material-UI.

- Initially started in JS and later refactored to TS to understand the pain points.
- Done without tutorial.
- During this project I quickly realised that I should not be focusing my efforts on designing a web page from scratch and stick with coding. As a result I set myself a challenge to make a Trello clone instead, sticking quite closely to the functionality and styling. The filtering behaviour isn't necessary for the direction this project is heading in so I'm going to draw a line under this one and clone it to a new repo so that the efforts here are not lost in commit history: https://github.com/adam-regan/trello-clone
